Book pages (*.md files) are ordered by the default directory ordering
(filename). A good practice is to start your filenames with a number, and pad
with leading zeros as necessary. Often two-digits is sufficient (supports 0-99
proper order).

Examples:
```
chapter01
  00-first-page.md
  01-second-page.md
  99-last-page.md
```

They don't have to be sequential; just named such that they alphanumerically
sort as desired.
